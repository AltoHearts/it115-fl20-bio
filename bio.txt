We are not limited in what we can create, but by what we can imagine.
My name is Maria O'Sullivan, and I an digtital artist, and software engineering student.

I strive to live life creatively and honestly. Life, art, and programing are all collaborative mediums,
and often times differnt perspectives will make or break a project. 
I offer a fresh minset and explorative thought processes on any project I undertake,
all while delivering a high quality product in a timely manner. 

Email me at mosullivan@sea.yearup.org if creativity, kindess, 
and quality results are values you want on your team.
